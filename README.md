leukemia has been a growing concern over the past decade, and early diagnosis is essential for initiating appropriate treatment. The diagnostic process is costly and time-consuming, involving medical specialists and multiple tests. Therefore, an automated diagnostic system for accurate prediction is of significant importance. Diagnosing leukemia using microarray gene data and machine learning approaches has become an important medical research topic today. This study proposes an approach for predicting leukemia using a supervised machine learning approach. For the present study, a leukemia microarray gene dataset containing 22,283 genes was used. For classification, a combined Logistic Vector Trees (LVTrees) classifier is proposed, which uses logistic regression, support vector classifier, and extra tree classifier. In addition to extensive experiments on the dataset, performance comparison with advanced methods was conducted to determine the significance of the proposed approach. To demonstrate the significance of the proposed approach, a T-test is performed. The T-test is a statistical test used to confirm a hypothesis about the performance of a model. It provides results in the form of acceptance and rejection of the null hypothesis. We have a null hypothesis; Null hypothesis: The proposed approach is statistically significant compared to other methods. Alternative hypothesis: The proposed approach is not statistically significant compared to other methods. The T-test accepted the null hypothesis when LVTrees was used with the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Technique (ADASYN) and a combination of ADASYN and Chi-square techniques compared to the original data, meaning that the proposed LVTrees is statistically significant in both cases when used with the ADASYN approach and a combination of ADASYN and Chi-square techniques. LVTrees rejected the null hypothesis when LVTrees was used with the Chi-square technique, meaning that LVTrees is not statistically significant compared to when LVTrees is applied to the original dataset. Additionally, LVTrees accepts the null hypothesis compared to other models used in all cases, demonstrating the importance of the proposed model. LVTrees with ADASYN and Chi-square techniques performed significantly better than all other models with 100% accuracy. The results show that a combination of multiple models can perform well compared to an individual model.
